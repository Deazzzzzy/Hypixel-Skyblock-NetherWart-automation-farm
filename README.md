# My own script for automation of farming nether warts with megafarm (link = https://youtu.be/iulR_wg3PWw?si=O4JQh0xJ7brt5DIU). Use it on your at your own risk. If you need, you can easily change some values to get script for wheat, carrot, potato e.t.c. One more warning each func use a certain time. It means that if adnims (somehow) find out this script they'll easily detect it. If you need to make this script harder to reveal you can use import random and change some values to random.uniform() e.g. time.sleep(120) to time.sleep(random.uniform(119.5,120.04))
